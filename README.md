# Solid color wallpaper creator

I don't use wallpapers due to a prefrence of having tiled windows, but I do have slight gaps between my
windows.

I noticed I had a very dark and grey desktop and felt it was quite depressing, so in an attempt to
be little more positive I wanted to cycle through various colours. So now I need to be able to create
a wide range quickly, so I built this :)
